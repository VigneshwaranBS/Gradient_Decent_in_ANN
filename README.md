# Gradient Descent in Deep Learning
Gradient descent is a popular optimization algorithm used in deep learning to minimize the loss function of a neural network. In this README file, we will explore the concept of gradient descent, its importance in deep learning, and how it can be implemented with and without libraries.

# What is Gradient Descent?
Gradient descent is an iterative optimization algorithm used to minimize the loss function of a neural network. It works by calculating the gradient of the loss function with respect to the network parameters and updating these parameters in the direction of the negative gradient to minimize the loss.

In other words, gradient descent is used to find the values of the parameters that minimize the difference between the predicted output and the actual output of the network. This is achieved by iteratively adjusting the values of the parameters until the difference between the predicted and actual output is as small as possible.

# Importance of Gradient Descent in Deep Learning
Gradient descent is a fundamental algorithm in deep learning and is used to train a wide variety of neural networks, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and deep belief networks (DBNs). Without gradient descent, it would be difficult to train deep neural networks with millions of parameters.

# Gradient Descent with Libraries
Implementing gradient descent with libraries such as TensorFlow or PyTorch is relatively straightforward. These libraries provide pre-built functions for calculating the gradients of the loss function with respect to the network parameters and updating the parameters using those gradients.

# Gradient Descent without Libraries
Implementing gradient descent without libraries can be more challenging but provides a deeper understanding of the algorithm. In this approach, we need to implement the forward and backward propagation steps of the neural network, calculate the gradients of the loss function with respect to the network parameters, and update the parameters using those gradients.

While this approach can be more time-consuming, it is beneficial for understanding the underlying mechanics of the algorithm and can also be useful in situations where libraries are not available or suitable for a particular task.

# Conclusion
Gradient descent is a fundamental optimization algorithm used in deep learning to minimize the loss function of a neural network. It is a powerful tool for training complex models with millions of parameters and can be implemented using libraries or by hand-coding the algorithm. Understanding gradient descent is essential for anyone interested in deep learning and neural networks.
